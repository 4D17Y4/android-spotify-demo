# spotify-demo
Using the Spotify Android SDK to play an audio track.

## Installing Android SDK
You can follow the [Spotify Android SDK Tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/tutorial/) to start the set up.

### Quick step
- Download the [Spotify Android playback library zip](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/release) and [Spotify Android auth library zip](https://github.com/spotify/android-auth/releases) from GitHub and unzip them.
- In a file explorer (not Android Studio), drag the unzipped spotify-auth-version.aar and spotify-player-version.aar files into the /app/libs directory in your projectâ€™s root directory.
- Playback library can be found when you unzip the zipfile. And simply copy this .aar into app/libs
- Auth library needs some more steps.

### Build .aar for auth library
- Download and unzip
- Remove the auth-sample directory since it is not needed to create .aar file
- In the `\android-auth-1.0\settings.gradle` file, add include ':app'
- Create `\android-auth-1.0\local.properties` and add `sdk.dir=/Users/%YOUR_PC_USERNAME%/Library/Android/sdk` for path to the Android SDK
- Run `./gradlew build` and grab an artifact from `auth-lib/build/outputs/aar/`.

## Generate SHA1 
This step is needed for registering application fingerprint
```sh
echo -n password | shasum -a 1 | awk '{print $1}'
```

## Dependency
```sh
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}

dependencies {
    ...

    compile 'com.spotify.sdk:spotify-android-auth-1.0.0@aar'
    compile 'com.spotify.sdk:spotify-player-24-noconnect-2.20b@aar'
}
```
